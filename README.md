## How It Works
- With the help of two temperature sensors, the ambient air and the flue gas temperature of the fireplace stove are measured continuously.
- In addition, a controllable flap is installed, which regulates the supply air of the stove.
- The measured temperatures can be constantly viewed and the supply air damper controlled via a nextion touch screen display. There are two main modes:
	- Manual mode: the flap can be changed manually with the touchscreen.
	- Automatic mode: the flap will be controlled automatically by the system according to a previously defined burn-off plan.

### Contributions and thanks
The support and help I got from the community has been nothing short of phenomenal. I can't thank you guys enough. This is my first real attept in developing open source stuff and I must say, now I understand why people are so dedicated to it, it is because of all the wonderful people involved.
